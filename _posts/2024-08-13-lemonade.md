# How AI-Native Companies Could Be Transformed: Case Lemonade

Nowadays, many companies are considering AI transformation to harness the potential of this widely hyped technology. However, some companies began as AI-native ‚Äî meaning they embedded AI as a core technological foundation from the start. As reality often catches up with even the most fashionable innovators, even AI-native companies may face the need for strategic transformation. This paper explores one such case.

Founded in 2015, **Lemonade** is a full-stack U.S. insurance company with a novel business concept (Collis & Ellet, 2024). Its founders viewed the traditional insurance model as flawed and instead created an insurance company grounded in AI, behavioral economics, and social impact. Lemonade applied digital technologies such as AI and blockchain to enhance customer insight, risk analysis, pricing, fraud detection, customer interface automation, and policy optimization. In a socially responsible twist, Lemonade donates unpaid claims to charities selected by its customers. It also published a "collaborative insurance policy" on GitHub to invite feedback and co-creation.

This approach exemplifies **low-cost disruptive innovation**, a concept championed by Clayton Christensen ‚Äî small companies developing solutions that incumbents failed to provide (Schildt, 2024, Day 2).

A few years ago, "insurtech" startups benefited from a surge in venture capital, and Lemonade secured $480 million in total investments. In 2020, it filed for an IPO with a valuation of $2 billion (Collis & Ellet, 2024). Despite steady revenue growth, the company remains unprofitable and aims for a positive EBITDA by 2026 (Yahoo Finance, 2024).

Using **Porter‚Äôs Five Forces**, Lemonade is a new entrant in the U.S. insurance market. Its biggest threat is competition from existing firms (Schildt, 2024, Day 2).

The **Lafley & Martin (2013)** strategy framework provides five essential decision areas for firms:

1. Define a winning aspiration
2. Decide where to play
3. Determine how to win
4. Identify core capabilities
5. Establish management systems

We explore three strategic scenarios for improving Lemonade‚Äôs performance. These scenarios are not entirely mutually exclusive, but resource constraints may prevent pursuing all simultaneously.

## Scenario 1: Acquisition by an Incumbent

A large incumbent insurer could acquire Lemonade, combining its extensive customer base with Lemonade‚Äôs innovations and efficiency. Risks include temporary business disruptions and cultural clashes. If successful, the resulting entity could become a dominant market player with substantial innovative and financial resources.

## Scenario 2: Becoming a Platform Provider

Lemonade could become a platform provider, offering its tech stack to other insurers. This would require investment in productization, sales, and support. While competitors like **EXL Service**, **SAS**, and **Accenture** already offer AI solutions in insurance (EXL, n.d.; SAS, n.d.; Accenture, n.d.), Lemonade can differentiate itself by demanding partner companies display a **‚ÄúPowered by Lemonade‚Äù** badge, enhancing brand presence.

Another variation is partnering with electronics retailers to offer Lemonade-branded insurance for devices ‚Äî e.g., after buying a TV, a customer is offered Lemonade insurance as an add-on. This could be attractive to both consumers and retailers.

## Scenario 3: Expanding Beyond Insurance

Lemonade could leverage its data and analytics capabilities to expand into adjacent financial services such as loans. It could analyze customer creditworthiness and use its strengths in UI design and customer experience to deliver delightful financial products beyond insurance.

## Next Steps

These scenarios are starting points. Strategic tools such as the **Business Model Canvas** (Schildt, 2024, p. 57), **Strategy Canvas** (Schildt, 2024, p. 49), and **scenario-based analysis** (Vilkkumaa, 2024) can deepen understanding and guide refinement.

It is crucial to involve diverse stakeholders for broader insights and buy-in. Strategy must remain adaptive: 
- Feedback loops should be fast (Schildt, 2024, p. 59)
- Strategic experiments should inform practice
- Internal communication should manage expectations around rapid change

All five Lafley & Martin (2013) strategy aspects should be considered. The platform or loan expansion strategies require capability renewal and new systems. Acquisition would redefine all five strategic dimensions for the merged entity.

Ultimately, the owners of Lemonade must be convinced of the need for transformation. Scenarios involving platform strategy or business expansion will likely require additional investment, while acquisition may not.
