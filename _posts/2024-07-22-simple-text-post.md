# What Silo AI Taught to Aalto EE Business Students in a One-day Workshop?



The Finnish AI company Silo AI gained lots of media coverage in July 2024 when it was sold to AMD in an all-cash transaction valued at $665 million. The sum is huge for a company of 300+ people that according to some source earned 15M€ revenue and made around 1M€ operative loss in 2023. The reasons for the AMD purchase must have been something else than huge earnings, obviously mainly the expertise gained in the company, having about half of its employees with a PhD degree.

With the above in mind, and in general the continuing huge interest around the AI topic, it would be interesting to know what Silo has learnt on its journey. We got an opportunity to listen to their teachings on March 13, 2024 when they gave a full day lecture for the Aalto University Executive Education course ‘AI for Leaders and Decision Makers’. From Silo they had Jaakko Vainio (Chief Business Officer), Elin Ehsani (Lead AI Scientist), and Mario Reiser (Lead AI Scientist, Delivery lead). We provide here our interpretation of their key learnings in a brief summary that focuses on the strategic and business aspects and provide also some commentary reflecting our own experiences on the same topics. So let’s start with the Silo teachings (some drumming and horns here please …).

* In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), many companies find themselves eager to capitalize on the potential benefits but often fall into common traps that hinder successful adoption. A prevalent issue is the tendency to apply AI to every problem, resulting in wasted resources and minimal impact. Organizations frequently launch projects based on trends or superficial applications without a strategic alignment with business objectives. This misalignment leads to initiatives that fail to deliver meaningful results and instead become costly experiments with little return on investment.
Another common mistake is assuming that AI solutions can be implemented “out of the box” without the need for substantial internal expertise or data preparation. Companies often rely heavily on external consultants, expecting instant success without investing in building their internal capabilities. This reliance can lead to a lack of ownership and understanding of the AI projects, making it difficult to sustain and scale AI solutions in the long run.
Moreover, many organizations underestimate the importance of data quality and infrastructure. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on, and without a solid data foundation, AI initiatives are likely to fail. Companies often attempt to address these challenges reactively rather than proactively, resulting in inefficient processes and unreliable outcomes.
To overcome these pitfalls and effectively integrate AI, companies should adopt a more strategic and disciplined approach. A critical first step is identifying the right use cases that align with the organization’s core business goals. Instead of pursuing AI for AI’s sake, companies should focus on projects that can drive significant value and competitive advantage. This involves starting with small, well-defined projects that can demonstrate tangible benefits, thereby building confidence and momentum for broader AI adoption.
Investing in data infrastructure is also crucial. Companies must ensure that they have high-quality, relevant data available and accessible for AI development. A robust data strategy, combined with a clear understanding of how data drives AI initiatives, is essential for building reliable and effective AI models.
The rise of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI presents unique opportunities for businesses to enhance operations and innovate. These technologies enable new forms of interaction, automation, and creativity, allowing companies to streamline processes, improve productivity, and develop innovative products and services. Leveraging LLMs as interfaces to complex systems can simplify user interactions and unlock more sophisticated applications.
Strategic planning and fostering AI literacy within the organization are key to successful adoption. Companies need a well-defined AI strategy that aligns with their broader business goals and involves building internal capabilities to reduce reliance on external expertise. Training and empowering teams with the necessary skills to harness AI’s full potential is crucial for sustainable success.
Finally, a long-term commitment to AI development and scaling is essential. Companies should plan for future growth, invest in scalable AI infrastructure, and embed AI at the core of their business operations. This approach ensures continuous improvement and value creation, enabling organizations to remain competitive and innovative in a dynamic environment.
In conclusion, by avoiding common mistakes and adopting a strategic, data-driven approach, companies can successfully integrate AI and harness its transformative potential. By focusing on strategic use cases, investing in data infrastructure, and fostering internal expertise, organizations can achieve lasting success and drive meaningful innovation through AI. *

So what is our take? With a more than a decade of experience about the AI topic in a large company it is easy to agree with the Silo’s observations and suggestions. Successful application of AI demands a lot from the companies/enterprises and the costs of wrong approaches can be substantial. At the same time pressure is building up to show progress with AI in order to harvest the potential of AI and to convince the stakeholders and public that the company/enterprise has not fallen behind the competition. The following prescription of Silo AI ‘companies should plan for future growth, invest in scalable AI infrastructure, and embed AI at the core of their business operations‘ can have very different meanings in different cases depending of whether one speaks e.g. about automation of manual processes, customer service automation or product embedded AI. It should be noticed as well that many companies do not have management systems that would steer the AI activities towards the proper path but rather cause the above mentioned problems to emerge due to e.g. distributed and fragmented responsibilities, fragmented and uncoordinated resource ownership and the wide ambitions to compete with showing progress in the AI leading to small, fragmented and strategically insignificant initiatives with no investments in common capabilities. According to our own experience the big resourceful companies start to be aware of the significant costs and risks related to AI, leading them to demand accordingly high enough value add before committing to any investments. For the rest of the companies and enterprises, please spread the message!
