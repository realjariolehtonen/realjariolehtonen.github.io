# A New Cookbook for Very Large Animals – Scenario-based AI Transformation

## Introduction

In AI projects it is desirable to have agile capabilities for strategy creation, R&D, deployment and maintenance, characterized by the DevOps and MLOps concepts. There are anyhow AI transformation cases when such agility is not possible, and long-term strategies over several years need to be created, involving significant risks. We will study one such case example from telecommunications, and apply a method designed to support the development of a robust, market-shaping strategy. In telecommunications it is typical that a long-lasting process is used to first define international standards by cooperating industry stakeholders, followed by a long development of proprietary embedded SW and HW products. In history this process has produced results of varying quality, typically achieving the introduction of new important services that have changed the world, but often also solutions that have not met their expectations despite of significant investments.

## Background of the Case Example

The case we are studying here is about the vendors of the cellular radio network (RAN) equipment, software and associated professional services for network operators and enterprises. The top 5 RAN suppliers based on worldwide revenues are Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE, and Samsung (Dell’Oro, 2024). Despite of the key nature of RANs in the global ICT infrastructure the RAN vendors are struggling with profitability in a flattening or even shrinking market. The global RAN market is now projected to decline 5 to 8 percent in 2024 (Dell’Oro, May 2024).

The recent Mobile World Congress 2024 showed a significant change of attitude and focus in the cellular industry (Antlitz and Soper 2024). The major new cellular technologies, 5G and 6G, were discussed very little, pointing to the challenges the telecom industry continues to face with revenue growth and ROI. The current challenges of the RAN vendors are largely a consequence of the business challenges and the bargaining power of their customers, the mobile communication service providers (CSPs). According to (Antlitz and Soper 2024) the CSPs have a track record of two decades of underachieving transformation initiatives and weakening business.

As in the past, the CSPs are still keen to discuss about B2B use cases, network slicing, private networks, cloud-native transformation, AI/GenAI and network APIs as key enablers of the digital economy and new revenue for themselves. But it seems that their strategic messages are losing credibility as it looks like they do not have sustainable value to show for their efforts in these areas. As a consequence the vendors are forced to adjust down their investments in the RAN business.

Mobile radio network regulations significantly impact vendors by shaping spectrum allocation, technical standards, competition policies, consumer protection, and safety requirements, according to OpenAI (2024). Spectrum allocation determines the frequencies available, while technical standards ensure their products are compatible globally. Competition rules foster a fair market, offering both opportunities and challenges. Consumer protection laws mandate high-quality service and data privacy, influencing product design. Environmental and safety standards require compliance, affecting manufacturing processes.

As the AI technologies are now being introduced to the vendor operations and products, the practical impacts of the emerging AI trustworthiness requirements and regulations in different regions and countries must be studied and understood as well. For the vendors, these regulations mean higher compliance costs and operational challenges but also drive innovation. Adhering to regulations provides a competitive edge, essential for maintaining and expanding market presence. Overall, regulations deeply influence the strategies and operations in the mobile network industry.

Given the currently challenging market outlook the RAN vendors are forced to adjust their bets and look carefully for the opportunities to invest in. This is challenging also because at the same time the vendors been forced to cut costs and lay off a significant portion of their employee base (Techblog 2024). AI is one topic in which the RAN vendors have tried to put more focus on. While the vendors already have a large number of AI and analytics initiatives, yet no major impact to the vendor business performance is not currently foreseen.

Reflecting the telecom industry status regarding the exploitation of AI in general, a very recent report by TM Forum about telecom operators revealed that:

> "There is nearly universal recognition that AI will lead to a paradigm shift in Communication Service Providers’ operating models. However, very few operators have a clear picture of what that operating model will or should be."  
— *TM Forum, 2024*

The 2023 Strategic Foresight Report provides a comprehensive overview of the sustainability challenges the European Union is facing (European Commission 2023). The global telecommunications industry knows many of those challenges as well. Climate neutrality and sustainability is high on the agendas of the CSPs, at least partially due to the fact that RAN energy costs represent a large part of the operational costs of their networks.

The importance of geopolitics has grown steeply in telecommunications, as in the ICT in general. Especially the growing technological confrontation between China and the west have caused trouble for the western vendors. There is a risk that the future 6G standard will be split to different specifications, and that would reduce the addressable market and increase development costs for the vendors (MERICS 2023). Some western vendors do have a significant R&D workforce in China, and there can be pressure from the west to reduce their presence in China. On the other hand the exclusion of the Chinese vendors from many western markets has in practice helped the business of the western vendors.

The playing field of the RAN vendors has thus grown extremely complex and demanding, and identifying and exploiting opportunities for growth requires understanding the future market and technological opportunities extremely well. There might be opportunities to expand the business to say e.g. satellite communications or IoT, but the limited economical resources of some vendors won’t help much with the challenge. As its customers the CSPs, the RAN vendors need to carefully focus their investments in the most important key topics such as AI, 6G and Open RAN (Dell’Oro, March 2024).

## Introduction to the Scenario-Based Analysis Method

The paper by Vilkkumaa et al. (2024) presents a model-based framework designed to support the development of a robust, market-shaping strategy. This framework is particularly tailored for strategic decision-making, where there are multiple conflicting objectives, long-term planning horizons, and significant uncertainties regarding future scenarios. The approach combines scenario planning with portfolio decision analysis to assist organizations in not only preparing for multiple potential futures but also in shaping the market towards desirable outcomes.

The core of the method lies in integrating scenario planning with robust portfolio decision analysis. Scenario planning is used to explore and define a range of plausible but distinct future scenarios that capture uncertainties in the operational environment. Portfolio decision analysis then comes into play to evaluate strategic actions across these scenarios, considering their scenario-specific impacts and the likelihoods of different scenarios occurring.

The framework is characterized by its ability to handle incomplete information—a common challenge in strategic decision-making. This includes incomplete preferences between objectives, undefined impacts of strategic actions, and uncertain scenario likelihoods. To address these, the authors develop new decision-analytic models and algorithms that generate strategic recommendations by identifying non-dominated action portfolios. These portfolios are robust across a variety of potential futures and can actively shape the market to increase the likelihood of more favorable scenarios.

The framework uses a stepwise approach for performing the analysis:

1. Development of Scenarios and Assessment of Scenario Likelihoods  
2. Definition of Strategic Objectives and Elicitation of Attribute Weights and Utility Functions  
3. Creation and Evaluation of Action Proposals  
4. Identification and Creation of Market-Shaping Action Proposals and Assessment of Their Impacts  
5. Development of the Decision-Analytic Portfolio Model  
6. Computation of Decision Recommendations  

## Futures Table

As the first step of the exercise we create a futures table with the following properties:

- A time frame between 3–7 years in the future  
- Identified 4–6 critical dimensions / drivers of change / key uncertainty factors that could impact the target organization within the chosen time frame. These can include technological innovations, market trends, regulatory changes, socio-cultural shifts, environmental factors, or geopolitical events.  
- Come up with 3–4 variable values / outcomes for each dimension.  
- The method involves selecting three interesting combinations of variable values / outcomes. We name the combinations and write one paragraph “Future state assessment / scenario narrative” for each combination.

### 1. Futures Table for 6G and AI

![Futures table for 6G and AI](/assets/futa6g2.jpg)

Based on the futures table above we have identified three different scenarios for the western vendors:

#### Scenario 1: *6G AI Dream*  
There is only one global standard for 6G. Market adoption of 6G is fast and demand for 6G RAN products is strong. AI is an essential part of 6G and provides significant benefits. Introduction of AI decreases vendor costs. Superior AI chip technology is available only to western 6G vendors.

#### Scenario 2: *Shrinking 6G*  
There is only one global 6G standard, but geopolitics fragment the market. Demand is moderate. AI provides no real benefit and becomes an unused feature. All vendors access high-performance AI chips.

#### Scenario 3: *6G and AI Crisis*  
The 6G standard fragments due to geopolitics. Market adoption is slow and demand weak. AI increases costs without benefit. Western vendors have inferior access to AI chips.

## Strategic Response

### The Strategic Objectives for the Western Vendors in 6G

In our study we are pursuing the following strategic objectives for the western vendors:

- Maximizing revenue  
- Achieving strong profitability  
- Contributing to the creation of a successful 6G ecosystem that includes mobile operators, network equipment vendors, mobile device vendors, enterprises, regulators and mobile application providers  

Next, we use the TOWS method for each of the three scenarios to identify the threats and opportunities posed by the scenario and the western vendors’ strengths and weaknesses in each case.

## Combined List of Action Proposals

We introduce here a combined list of action proposals based on the previous step. The actions are evaluated based on how they help attain the strategic objectives in different scenarios.

![Combined List of Action Proposals](/assets/combined_action_list.jpg)  
*Actions marked with green have a positive impact to the strategy given the scenario, yellow means neutral impact, and red means negative impact.*

### Ranking of Scenarios

The three studied scenarios ranked from most desired to least desired are:

1. 6G AI Dream  
2. Shrinking 6G  
3. 6G and AI Crisis

### Impact of Actions on Scenario Probability

**Actions that increase the probability of the 6G AI Dream scenario:**

- Invest significantly in the development of the 6G ecosystem (vendors, operators, application providers)  
- Invest big time in 6G in AI. Invest already in 5G in AI and create a common reusable platform for 5G and 6G AI solutions  
- Create AI solutions that utilize maximally the better AI chips accessed by the western vendors  
- Create AI-enhanced 6G solutions that have superior performance compared to the non-western vendors dominating the non-western market  

**Actions that decrease the probability of the 6G AI Dream scenario:**

- Skip the investments in AI technology and redirect and readjust the resources reserved for AI work  
- Try to downplay and delay 6G as much as possible, promote 5G evolution instead  
- Start an initiative to develop 7G standards in order to skip 6G altogether  

**Actions that increase the probability of the Shrinking 6G scenario:**

- Skip the investments in AI technology and redirect and readjust the resources reserved for AI work  
- Start an initiative to develop 7G standards in order to skip 6G altogether  

**Actions that increase the probability of the 6G and AI Crisis scenario:**

- Skip the investments in AI technology and redirect and readjust the resources reserved for AI work  
- Start an initiative to develop 7G standards in order to skip 6G altogether  

**Negative impact actions for the less desired scenarios:**

- Same as those having positive impact in the 6G AI Dream scenario  

## Recommended Actions for the Western Vendors

Based on our analysis, we recommend the following actions to be performed by the western vendors:

- **Invest significantly in the development of the 6G ecosystem** (vendors, operators, application providers, regulators, governments, etc.). One global standard for 6G should be targeted, and a strong ecosystem should be built to ensure there will be compelling end-to-end products that drive market need for 6G solutions  
- **Invest big time in AI for 6G** — and already for 5G — and create a common reusable platform for 5G and 6G AI solutions  
- **Create AI solutions that utilize the superior AI chips** accessible to the western vendors  
- **Create AI-enhanced 6G solutions** that outperform the products of non-western vendors dominating their home markets  

### Preparation for Non-desired Scenarios

To avoid negative consequences if the desired scenarios don’t materialize, western vendors should:

- Continuously review and update their scenario analyses  
- Be prepared with fallback strategies based on the undesired scenarios  
- Monitor the effectiveness of implemented actions  
- Share risk analysis across the whole 6G ecosystem  
- Outsource high-risk 6G AI research to publicly funded initiatives when possible  

## Conclusions

In our case study, we managed to produce a set of prioritized strategic actions for the western vendors that would:

- Maximize 6G business performance under desirable scenarios  
- Improve resilience against less favorable futures  
- Influence the probability of favorable scenarios and reduce the risk of undesired ones  

We found the scenario-based portfolio method a clear improvement over typical strategic methods used in telecommunications. The biggest benefit is its **acknowledgement of uncertainty** — rather than assuming a single future, it offers guidance across **multiple possible outcomes**. This approach is particularly valuable in industries like telecom where **risk tolerance is low** and **investment cycles are long**.

Though our case study is limited in scope, we believe the methodology can scale well:

- By involving multiple independent teams and comparing their outputs  
- By applying generative AI to create, iterate, and refine strategic options — initial experiments suggest this could significantly boost analysis capacity
